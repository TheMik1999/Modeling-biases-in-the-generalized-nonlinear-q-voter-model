# Modeling biases in the generalized nonlinear q-voter model
 Codes used to generate results for publication "Modeling biases in binary decision-making within the generalized nonlinear q-voter model"

 ## Parameters 
 - N  - Number of agents
 - q  - size of grupe of influencse 
 - epsilon_up_arrow -
 - epsilon_down_arrow -

### Figure
A figure to remind you of the meaning of the parameters

![Schematic diagram of our model illustrating possible scenarios in which a target agent (inside the circle) may change its state. Examples are provided for $q=4$. Black (white) agents represent adopted (unadopted) agents, while gray agents indicate agents in an arbitrary state. In scenarios (a) and (b), the target agentâ€™s state changes independently of its initial state because the $q$-panel is unanimous. Cases (c) and (d) represent situations where the $q$-panel is not unanimous, meaning that the probability of changing state depends on the target agent's initial state: (c) the target agent is adopted and switches to an unadopted state with probability $\varepsilon_\downarrow$; otherwise, it retains its original state; (d) the target agent is unadopted and adopts with probability $\varepsilon_\uparrow$; otherwise, it retains its original state.](model_scheme.pdf)

 ## Files
 ### one_step_function.jl
Main function that describes the MoneCarlo elemetary step($\Delta t= 1/N $) in the simulation.
 ### trajectory_simulation.jl
 Temporal trajectories from dymulation for given q,epsilon_up_arrow,epsilon_down_arrow values. The file has been modified for calculating multiple initial conditions
