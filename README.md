 Codes used to generate results for publication "Modeling biases in binary decision-making within the generalized nonlinear q-voter model"
 [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10172)
 ## Parameters 
 - **N**  - Number of agents
 - **q**  - size of grupe of influencse 
 - **epsilon_up_arrow** -
 - **epsilon_down_arrow** -

In the code, **epsilon_up_arrow** and **epsilon_down_arrow** can be labeled **e1** and **e2**, respectively
### Figure

**Caption:** 
Schematic diagram of our model illustrating possible scenarios in which a target agent (inside the circle) may change its state. Examples are provided for $q=4$. Black (white) agents represent adopted (unadopted) agents, while gray agents indicate agents in an arbitrary state. In scenarios (a) and (b), the target agentâ€™s state changes independently of its initial state because the $q$-panel is unanimous. Cases (c) and (d) represent situations where the $q$-panel is not unanimous, meaning that the probability of changing state depends on the target agent's initial state: (c) the target agent is adopted and switches to an unadopted state with probability $\varepsilon_\downarrow$; otherwise, it retains its original state; (d) the target agent is unadopted and adopts with probability $\varepsilon_\uparrow$; otherwise, it retains its original state.
 ## Files
 ### Simulation
 The model was implemented on a complete graph, so in the case of simulation, it allowed us to forget the network structure and remember only the number of agents adapted (**N_up**) 
 #### one_step_function.jl [View file](one_step_function.jl)
 
Main function that describes the MoneCarlo elemetary step($\Delta t= 1/N $) in the simulation.
 #### trajectory_simulation.jl [View file](trajectory_simulation.jl)
 
 Time trajectories from symulation for given **q**,**epsilon_up_arrow**,**epsilon_down_arrow values**. The file has been modified for calculating multiple initial conditions  
 #### exitprobability_simulation.jl [View file](exitprobability_simulation.jl)
 Code used to calculate exit probability from simulation.

 ### Analytical
 #### trajectory_analitical_plus_stab_point.jl [View file](trajectory_analitical_plus_stab_point.jl )
Time trajectories from analytics for given **q**,**epsilon_up_arrow**,**epsilon_down_arrow values**.
In these cases were added stable and unstable points that occur in the system for the given parameters.

 #### phase_portrait.jl [View file](phase_portrait.jl)
 Preparation of a phase portrait for a given q.
In the code, we look for fixed points and check their stability. The code generates temporary phase numbers as well as the number of fixed points for a grid of **epsilon_up_arrow** and **epsilon_down_arrow values** values.
